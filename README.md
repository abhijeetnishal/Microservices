# Microservices Architecture with Spring Boot

## Overview

This project is a microservices-based application built using Spring Boot. It currently includes a `User Service`, with the potential to add more services like `Post Service` and others in the future. Each service is designed to be independent, scalable, and maintainable, and communicates with others using REST APIs. We are using MySQL as the database for our services.
